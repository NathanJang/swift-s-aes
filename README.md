# swift-s-aes

**WARNING: this project is not intended for use in production! It was just a programming exercise.**

This project is a Swift implementation of my IB Mathematics HL Exploration of Simplified AES.
All code here is highly inefficient for real applications but illustrates how to encrypt and decrypt by hand, which was the intention of my Exploration.
